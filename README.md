Using over 20k tunes in ABC notation from https://thesession.org/ and awesome deep learning library called [Keras](http://keras.io/) I've trained a multi-layer recurrent neural model that can build some melodies from scratch predicting exactly the next character in the text representation of a song. The output of this model then gets converted to MP3 format so it can be played in a browser right away.
